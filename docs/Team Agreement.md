# Team Agreement

**Team name:** The mega cool people (TBC)

## Members

**Team lead: All**



## Making decisions

All ideas will be discussed as a group and a decision will be made based on majority voting. If no majority is reached, the leader's vote will decide the outcome.

## Managing work

### Feedback and communications

All communication will be done via Discord, except for bug reports and feature tracking.

Bug reports and feature tracking will be done via [GitHub's built-in issue tracking](https://csgit.bhasvic.ac.uk/cool-people/animopoly/issues).

### File sharing and storage

Files will be stored and shared via the shared repository on BHASVIC's GitHub Enterprise server.

Each person will complete their work in separate branches, then create a Pull Request to merge their work into the `main` branch.

**Creating a branch:**

- Pull the latest changes from the repo via GitKraken
- Click the "Branch" icon at the top
- Enter a branch name, starting with `<your initials>/`, e.g. `dw/` (this allows us to see who is working on which feature)

**Creating a pull request:**

- Ensure you push your latest work to GitHub (click Push at the top of GitKraken and press Confirm if needed)
- Go to the [Pull Request page on GitHub](https://csgit.bhasvic.ac.uk/cool-people/animopoly/compare)
- Select your branch in the right-hand box
- Click "Create pull request"
- Enter brief details about what your Pull Request adds to the project
- Wait for it to be reviewed and merged into `main`

### Asking for help

Discord is always open for everyone to ask each other questions. No question is a dumb question.

### What to do with team members that are behind

Help them out! Ask if they're stuck or need some help with something.
